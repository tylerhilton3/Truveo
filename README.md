## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project was sites like groundnews, which provide unbiased information on the political spectrum's coverage of news. We wanted to make something similar that was more entertaining.

## What it does
When given a link to an article, our program will create a video summary of the article with a review of the credibility of the facts, authors, and sources within it. It automatically generates background footage and a voice-over of the script.

## How we built it
We started with a skeleton on the whiteboard with markers to draw the relationships between the different files and objects. Then we created files for related groups of functions, dealt with asset collection and management, as well as deletion of temporary assets, and then created a UI script in main.py that executed everything in the order that worked well.

## Challenges we ran into
By far the biggest struggle/waste of time we ran into was finding the right APIs to use. Other challenges for us were git functions, misunderstood dependencies, API implementation, and general code organization.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of our ability to integrate a huge variety of technologies, APIs, and functions of different capabilities into a cohesive program.

## What we learned
We learned several frameworks, source control strategies, and most importantly, methods of troubleshooting things as a team.

## What's next for Truveo
UI improvements, YouTube query specificity improvements, local LLM hosting, and more complicated audio/visual structure.
